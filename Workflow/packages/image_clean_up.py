"""
Cleans up the images to display connected hydrides and plots them side-by-side for comparison.

Inputs:

image_list - list of thresholded (binary images).

pure_image_list - list of non-thresholded images (for the sake of comparison).

Outputs:

None - (visual representation is enough in this case).
